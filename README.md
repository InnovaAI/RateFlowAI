# USD to TSH Exchange Rate Prediction Using AI

Welcome to the **USD to TSH Exchange Rate Prediction** project! This project leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to predict the exchange rate between the US Dollar (USD) and the Tanzanian Shilling (TSH). It is designed to provide valuable insights for anyone looking to forecast exchange rate trends and make informed financial decisions.

## üìå **About the Project**

This project aims to develop a robust AI-based model to predict the exchange rate between the US Dollar (USD) and the Tanzanian Shilling (TSH). With global exchange rates being volatile, our solution uses Python and cutting-edge machine learning techniques to forecast future rates, empowering businesses, investors, and individuals to make smarter financial choices.

## üöÄ **Key Features**

- **Predictive Model**: The AI model predicts future exchange rates based on historical data.
- **Real-time Data Integration**: The model can be extended to work with real-time exchange rate data sources.
- **Python-Based**: The project is built entirely in Python, making it easy to extend, modify, and integrate with other systems.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: We utilize state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to train and test our models for optimal performance.
  
## üõ† **Technologies Used**

- Python 3
- Machine Learning (ML)
- Data Preprocessing: Pandas, NumPy
- Machine Learning Framework: scikit-learn, TensorFlow (or any other ML framework you are using)
- Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Data Sources: APIs or datasets with historical exchange rate data

## üí° **Future Vision**

This project is designed to evolve into a more sophisticated tool for predicting exchange rates not just for USD/TSH, but for other currencies as well. As we gather more data and improve the model, we aim to integrate additional features such as:
- Real-time exchange rate predictions.
- Cross-currency exchange rate forecasts.
- Enhanced accuracy using deep learning models like LSTMs or reinforcement learning.
  
## üåç **How to Use**

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/InnovaAI/RateFlowAI.git
   ```
   
2. **Install dependencies**:
   Make sure to install all the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the model**:
   Use the provided scripts to train and predict exchange rates.
   Example:
   ```bash
   python trainModel.py
   python predictRate.py
   ```

4. **Customize**:
   - Replace the historical exchange rate dataset with a custom one if desired.
   - Tweak the model parameters or try different machine learning algorithms to enhance prediction accuracy.

## üìä **Data**

The data used for training the models is based on historical exchange rates between USD and TSH. For maximum prediction accuracy, we recommend updating the dataset periodically.

If you have access to a real-time exchange rate API, you can easily integrate that into the project to make the predictions more current.

## üîß **Installation**

You can clone this repository and install the necessary libraries by following these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/InnovaAI/RateFlowAI.git
cd usd-tsh-exchangePrediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üõ† **Usage**

After installing, you can start the prediction script with:
```bash
python predictRate.py
```

This will show the predicted USD to TSH exchange rate based on the trained model.
